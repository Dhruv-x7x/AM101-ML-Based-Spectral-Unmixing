## Survey of Spectral Unmixing Algorithms by Nirmal Keshava

I started reading this survey to understand spectral unmixing in more detail. I made handwritten notes which I plan to transcribe here when I feel comfortable with the content. The majority of what I read evolved around hierarchial taxonomies of unmixing algorithms described by Keshava. He divides these algorithms into 3 stages and at each stage presrcibes the rules for the hierarchy based on the fundamental assumptions taken by the algorithms. 

The three stages of an unmixing algorithm are:
- Dimensionality Reduction
- Endmember Determination
- Inversion

There is still a lot more to cover and I plan to finish up to page 15 tomorrow.
