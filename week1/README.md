## Week 1 Goals
- Explore the HySUPP python package                                 DONE âœ…
- Explore the free HSI datasets from the list I found.
- Read the survey on spectral unmixing algorithms by Nirmal Keshava
- Read the following papers (to get an idea of the algorithm, not a deep dive):
  - "Solving Spectrum Unmixing as a Multi-Task Bayesian Inverse Problem with Latent Factors for Endmember Variability" Wu et al
  - "Probabilistic Mixture Model-Based Spectral Unmixing" Hoidn et al
  - "Fast and Reliable Noise Estimation for Hyperspectral Subspace Identification" Benner et al (HYSIME)
