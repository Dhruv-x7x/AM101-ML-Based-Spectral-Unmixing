## Probabilistic Mixture Model-Based Spectral Unmixing

This is a survey into a paper by Hoidn et al. The paper takes a bayesian inference approach to unmixing problems in contrast to the geometric algorithms that are popular (e.g. N-FINDR). 
Bayesian approach explicitly "acknowledges and incorporates epistemic uncertainties" and "aleatoric uncertainties" meaning that along with extracting endmembers and abundances, the model also quantifies the uncertainties in these estimations. The paper boasts of the model's confidence to make informed decisions under uncertainty.
