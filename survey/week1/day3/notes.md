## Continued reading the survey
The survey has split the algorithms into statistical and non-statistical methods. My main focus today was to read about the parametric statistical methods like MAP estimation which is a bayesian method that I used for pan-sharpening. I did not get to read much about it today and plan to continue it tomorrow.

## GPU
I looked into the datasets and found them to be extremely large. Any algorithm that I found interesting would not work on my laptop with only 16GB RAM. Cropping seems to be the only way for me to do an initial implementation. I looked into renting GPUs and found NVIDIA's T4s and A100s on google cloud to be a cheap option.
